###### Note:

** this app is provided as is, I don't hold any responsibilty is the marks you get don't correspond with the university you're using this app with, each instituation has subtle differences in the way in which they calculate point averages, some choose to keep grades upto two sig figs some choose three while other four or five, there is also the effect of P/F courses. **
